# SpaceShapes | Java |
### SOFTENG 251 Assignment
Java Swing GUI application that displays multiple moving shapes that bounces within a window.

##

## Setting up the program
1. Unzip file 
2. On startup the Space-Shapes application attempts to read configuration information from the
file named "spaceshapes.properties". You should locate this file within your logon directory. For
home PCs running Windows, the logon directory is C:/Users/username. 

## Executing the program
1. Run "SpaceShape.java". This should be located in the folder .../spaceShapesProject/SpaceShapes-IIISource/spaceshapes/shapesApp

2. A window should pop up with the GUI application - an example of adding a shape is shown below:

#### Disclaimer
Not all code is written by me - this was a project for SOFTENG 251, where Paramvir Singh provided the base code. 
Most subclasses in SpaceShapes are created by me.
